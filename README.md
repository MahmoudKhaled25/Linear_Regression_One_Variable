# Linear Regression with One Variable

This project implements linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise based on the advertising budget. The dataset consists of input features (e.g., advertising budget in $1000s) and corresponding target values (e.g., profits in $1000s).

## Project Overview

### Features
- **Linear Regression**: We implement a linear model to predict profits based on a single feature (advertising budget).
- **Cost Function**: The cost function is calculated to evaluate the performance of the linear model.
- **Gradient Descent**: This algorithm optimizes the parameters by minimizing the cost function.
